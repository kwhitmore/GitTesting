Liquibase core is currently built using Ant.

The main end-builder Ant targets are:

  package:          builds the output artifacts (*.jar, *.zip, *.tar.gz). Both sources
                    and binary artifacts are packaged, including jdk1.4 targeted ones

  compile:          compiles the sources (1.5 bytecode)

  clean:            cleans the output folders and all the previously generated artifacts

  site:             builds the project's site from static resources (*.html)

  test:             executes the unit tests

  test-int:         executes the integration tests (requires a running accesible db runtime)

  all (default):    performs a complete build of the project


If you wish to override any of the standard build properties for your paticular environment,
please create a build.local.properties file in src and do not check it into SVN
(it should already be marked as SVN ignore).
